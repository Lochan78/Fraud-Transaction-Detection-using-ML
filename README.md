# Fraud-Transaction-Detection-using-ML
Fraudulent transactions represent a significant issue in the financial sector. The goal of this project is to detect fraud by analyzing transaction data using machine learning models. The project leverages historical transaction data to build a classifier capable of predicting if a transaction is fraudulent or not.
